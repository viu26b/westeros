                     <p class="story-time">House Targaryen seemed content to live out the rest of its existence as the rulers of Dragonstone and nothing more, until Aegon Targaryen I was born. Young, strong, bold, assertive, and arrogant, Aegon had a taste for battle and aspirations that stretched much farther than Dragonstone. With the mindset of re-establishing the great Valyrian empire, Aegon set his sights west toward Westeros. He began his conquest initially by holding a meeting with his sisters and his bannermen, wherein he wrote and sent letters to every ruler in the Seven Kingdoms announcing himself as the new king of a unified realm. He promised that those who submitted to him as king of the realm would keep their lands and titles, and that those who didn't would be destroyed. Some ruling Houses submitted and kneeled immediately while others chose to stand their ground and wage war. In response to this, Aegon separated his forces into 3 teams, with each team consisting of members of the Targaryen army and the armies of their bannermen, as well as escorted by each Targaryen heir and their dragon. These are the Wars of Conquest.</p>

With an army that far outnumbered that of the Targaryens, King Argilac felt certain of victory. However, the reality of his enemies' dragonfire soon laid waste to most of King Argilac's army, and he lost his life while in a one-on-one duel against the enemy. Now with control over the Stormlands, Aegon appointed one his bannermen, Orys Baratheon, the new ruler of the Stormlands and House Baratheon as the new noble house of those lands.</p>

Aided by the Targaryen army, his dragon, and a popular uprising against the ironborn king led by House Tully (of the Riverlands), Aegon successfully decimated the enemy army and holed King Harren in his castle called Harrenhal. Even with no place to turn, King Harren still refused to surrender and submit, so Aegon had his dragon, Balerion the Dread, burn Harrenhal to the ground with King Harren, his family, and his remaining supporters still in it.</p>

With the combined forces of House Lannister and House Gardener, Aegon was up against over 55,000 soldiers ready for battle. The numbers were so far from his favor that Aegon and his sisters released all 3 of their dragons on the enemy. The aftermath saw the full destruction of House Gardener and an eventual submission of House Lannister. House Lannister was now made Lords of the Westernlands while House Tyrell (former stewards of House Gardener) was made Lords of the Reach.</p>

With the conquering of the Vale, Aegon had successfully unified six of the seven kingdoms under his rule.</p>

The Red Keep is a castle that was made using bright red bricks. It was rumored that Aegon chose the color for the bricks specifically so that his Westerosi subjects wouldn't forget the dragon fire he roasted his enemies with. A visual reminder of the consequence of defiance. The Red Keep is also where Aegon collected all the swords of his enemies and had his dragon, Balerion the Dread, melt them into his Iron Throne.</p>

When used to make bladed weaponry,<br> Valyrian steel was praised for its strength, durability, light-weight, and sharpness.<br> Weapons made from Valyrian steel also never dulled so once created,<br> a weapon forged from the steel could last generations and remain untarnished.<br> After the Doom of Valyria, no new Valyrian steel weapons could be made, as the city's destruction vanished the metal. The Valyrian steel weapons owned by the Targaryens and the ones circulating via trade are the only ones that remain,<br> so they are considered both rare and very valuable.</p>
